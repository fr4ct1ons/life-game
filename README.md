# life-game
Repository for a college project, containing an implementation of John Conway's Game of Life.  

Subject: Basic Data Structures I  
Teacher: Selan Rodrigues Santos  
Authors: Gabriel Lucena (fr4ct1ons) and Weverson Paulo (Versinho)  

## About  
John Conway's Game of Life is a computational game consisting of various cells that are either alive or dead. That is determined by various rules. For checking each and every rule, please, read the [Wikipedia page on the game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). 

## How to install
Once you have downloaded the program's files, open the command-line (linux), switch to the directory containing the program's files and simply type `make` and it will compile the program.  
Alternatively. you can compile it all by using the following command:  
`g++ -std=C++11 -o lifesim source/image_gen.cpp source/life.cpp source/life_game.cpp main/main.cpp`  

## Usage
Again, on the terminal, run the program by typing:
`./lifesim -input <inputfile> <options>`  
Here are the following options you can use:
